hey guys, we have been following really different naming conventions,
so let's try to get that fixed up.

1. files should only be lowercase
2. class names should be have all words capitalized
    ex. class Fluid
    Fluid *fluid;
    fluid = new Fluid

    Physics physics;
    physics = new IncompInvisc();

    note how both Incomp and Invisc

3. functions should have first letter LOWER CASE and all
    other words capitalized

    ex. addParticles(Properties properties);
    non-ex: AddParticles(); (<-- don't do this)

4. variables and instantiated objects should be all lower case

  ex. Physics physics; (note how physics is an example of the class Physics)
  ex. int numberparticles_


Please go back and make sure all your files are compatible with this
Scott and I (Kevin) have fixed a lot of it
