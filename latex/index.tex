sph is a smoothed particle hydrodynamics solver. \-This is a \-Langrangian, i.\-e., not a fixed grid, solver which tracks particles and their properties instead of properties at fixed grid spaces. \-This is useful for investigating free surface problems and mixing of fluids with different properties.

\-The driver program is \hyperlink{sph_8cc}{sph.\-cc}. \-Usage\-: sph $<$init\-File$>$ $<$boundary\-File(\-O\-P\-T\-I\-O\-N\-A\-L)$>$ $<$t\-Final$>$ $<$timestep$>$ $<$integrator$>$ $<$kernel$>$

\-Associated with sph is \hyperlink{tests_8cc}{tests.\-cc}, which is the driver program for testing classes and structs used by sph.

\-Usage\-: tests
